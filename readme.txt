# [Project 1: Bikeshare Demand Prediction]
- Worked on this project as part of my assigments while attending the Data Science course at General Assembly. Data was provided by the school. 
- The data, collected hourly for a period of two years, gives information regarding the number of rented bikes, weather conditions and day of the week
- The scope was to build a robust model to predict the demand of bike rentals and both GBR and XGB were used and results compared.
